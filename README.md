It is a multi-tenant, high-performance solution for server-to-server messaging. In the context of this study, is the responsible for making messages reach their destination, from service to service and it is containerized using [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/) technology. For the [Java technology](https://www.java.com/en/), there is a Java client that allows creating Pulsar producers, consumers, and readers and perform administrative tasks, all thread-safe.               |
| 2  | ![Docker](README.files/Logo-Docker.png)                | [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/)                                 | Docker is a software platform that helps developers package their software into containers, which include everything needed to run the application, like code, runtime, libraries, and system tools. It eases development allowing to simulate a real world multi services scenario.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

It does not index the contents of the logs, only metadata about the logsâ€™ labels. Log data itself is then compressed and stored in chunks in object stores. In the context of this study, it's containerized using Docker technology and receives the data from the OpenTelemetry Collector.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

In the context of this study there are three different types of Java applications, two of them are services that communicate between each other through messages, and the third one is the OpenTelemetry [Java Agent](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/zero-code/java/agent/) that collects and export telemetry data.                                                                                                    |
| 7  | ![Open Telemetry](README.files/Logo-OpenTelemetry.png) | [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/what-is-opentelemetry/)     | An observability framework and toolkit designed to facilitate the generation, export, and collection of telemetry data such as traces, metrics, and logs. For Java developers it is a set of observability tools that consist of the API, the SDK, and instrumentation. It includes a [Java Agent](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/zero-code/java/agent/) that allows Zero-code instrumentation with a JAR attached to any Java 8+ application. It dynamically injects bytecode to capture telemetry from many popular libraries and frameworks. |

[Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot), on the other hand, is an extension of the Spring Framework that provides auto-configuration and "convention over configuration". It aims to make building and deploying Spring-based applications easier and faster.                                       |
| 10 | ![Service](README.files/Logo-Service.png)              | Service Application                                                       | A smaller, independent application from a large ecosystem of applications that (usually) communicate with each other.

| 1 | TBD  | Service 1a | A Spring Powered Service with OTEL Java Agent responsible to create the first message that will pass through each service. Its goal is to understand and configure how Spring Boot + OTEL Java Agent solution must be used to produce messages to Pulsar topics in order to provide telemetry data. At the time of this writing, all telemetry data has been successful distributed and displayed in Grafana dashboards (logs, tracing and metrics). |

## Docker references

It seems to be a complete guide to put the entire ecosystem working!

## Next Steps:

### Yet to achieve:

- Logging using OpenTelemetry and OTEL Collector
  - In a simple Java Application w/ OTEL SDK
- Metrics using OpenTelemetry and OTEL Collector
  - In a simple Java Application w/ OTEL SDK
- Grafana through Loki
  - In a simple Java Application w/ OTEL SDK

### Use Grafana Alloy instead of OTEL Collector

Grafana already has its own solution for collecting logs, traces and metrics called Grafana Alloy. This is the "de 
facto" real-world solution used.

### Split a message into two or more. All of them must have the same trace ID

If a consumed message must be transformed in two or more and using multithreading publish to other Pulsar topic(s), all 
messages must keep the same trace ID.

### Keep applications alive

Find a way to start and keep alive applications even though Pulsar is not available
