| ![Apache-Pulsar](./README.files/Logo-Apache-Pulsar.png) | [Apache Pulsar](https://pulsar.apache.org/docs/4.0.x/concepts-overview/) | Distributed Messaging and Streaming tool. It is a multi-tenant, high-performance solution for server-to-server messaging. In the context of this study, is the responsible for making messages reach their destination, from service to service and it is containerized using [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/) technology. For the [Java technology](https://www.java.com/en/), there is a Java client that allows creating Pulsar producers, consumers, and readers and perform administrative tasks, all thread-safe.               | 
| ![Docker](./README.files/Logo-Docker.png)               | [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/)                                | Docker is a software platform that helps developers package their software into containers, which include everything needed to run the application, like code, runtime, libraries, and system tools. It eases development allowing to simulate a real world multi services scenario.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

In the context of this study, is the responsible for displaying logs, metrics and tracing information with dashboards accessible by the browser and it is containerized using Docker technology.                                                                                                                       |

It does not index the contents of the logs, only metadata about the logsâ€™ labels. Log data itself is then compressed and stored in chunks in object stores. In the context of this study, it's containerized using Docker technology and receives the data from the OpenTelemetry Collector.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

It allows to search for traces, generate metrics from spans, and link tracing data with logs and metrics. In the context of this study, it's containerized using Docker technology and receives the data from the OpenTelemetry Collector.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

In the context of this study there are three different types of Java applications, two of them are services that communicate between each other through messages, and the third one is the OpenTelemetry [Java Agent](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/zero-code/java/agent/) that collects and export telemetry data.                                                                                                    |

For Java developers it is a set of observability tools that consist of the API, the SDK, and instrumentation. It includes a [Java Agent](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/zero-code/java/agent/) that allows Zero-code instrumentation with a JAR attached to any Java 8+ application. It dynamically injects bytecode to capture telemetry from many popular libraries and frameworks. |

## Docker references

It seems to be a complete guide to put the entire ecosystem working!

## Next Steps:

### Split a message into two or more. All of them must have the same trace ID

If a consumed message must be transformed in two or more and using multithreading publish to other Pulsar topic(s), all 
messages must keep the same trace ID.

### Keep alive applications

Find a away to start and keep alive applications even though Pulsar is not available
